title: "The Afro Groove Library | The Groove Library"
description:<p> Rooted in music from and inspired by Africa, this series explores rhythm as both heritage and evolution — moving between traditional forms, vintage recordings, modern productions, edits, fusions and underground mutations.</p

<p>Across DJ mixes, live sessions, guest selectors and deep listening experiences, The Afro Groove Library traces connections between highlife, Afro-funk, desert blues, spiritual jazz, dub, house, broken beat, electronic experiments and everything in-between. It honours the source while embracing forward motion.</p

<p>This is not a museum of sound — it’s a living archive.
Built for dancers, listeners, collectors and curious minds.
Equal parts ritual, system culture and future exploration.</p

<p>Where the roots run deep… and the groove keeps moving.</p>
