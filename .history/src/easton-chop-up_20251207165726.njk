title: "Easton Chop Up! | The Groove Library"
description: >
  <p>a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/legendarymusic/playlists/easton-chop-up/" target="_blank">Easton Chop Up</a> began as a love letter to music from and inspired by Africa, rooted in the vibrant, multicultural energy of Easton, Bristol. For over a decade, it lived as a mix series, an occasional club night, and a home for deep musical exploration — from highlife and Afro-funk to jazz, dub, electronic mutations and beyond.</p>

  <p>What started as local quickly found a wider audience. Easton Chop Up became a space for late-night listeners and open-minded dancers and built on curiosity rather than trends. It championed both the roots and the forward motion of global sound, always with respect for tradition and a hunger for discovery.</p>

  <p>As I have now relocated beyond Bristol, Easton Chop Up transitions into its next chapter under a new name: The Groove Library — expanding its scope from Africa-centred inspiration to a truly global musical archive, while carrying forward the same values of depth, warmth, movement and cultural dialogue.</p>

  <p>This page stands as the archive and foundation of that journey.</p>
