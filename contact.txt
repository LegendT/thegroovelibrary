Contribute

The Groove Library is shaped through curated invitations, but we genuinely enjoy discovering new selectors, writers and projects along the way.

If you’d like to share something with us, you’re very welcome to send:

A link to a recent mix

A piece of writing about music

Or a project you’re proud of

Everything that’s sent is listened to or read. If it feels like a natural fit for one of the The Groove Library libraries, we’ll be in touch.
